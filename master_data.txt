Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means.   Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice.  Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skill-attributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training.  An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy - this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected.   This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies.

In the linguistic realm, interpretation typically involves constructing representations that are richer than the content that is linguistically encoded, and this enrichment is plausibly the result, in part, of the expectation of coherence. This expectation has far reaching effects, including on the assignment of referents to pronouns, the interpretation of definite and indefinite noun phrases, assignment of temporal relations, and the identification of Gricean conversational implicatures.

CC: With the growing number of massive datasets in applications such as machine learning and numerical linear algebra, classical algorithms for processing such datasets are often no longer feasible. In this course we will cover algorithmic techniques, models, and lower bounds for handling such data. A common theme is the use of randomized methods, such as sketching and sampling, to provide dimensionality reduction. In the context of optimization problems, this leads to faster algorithms, and we will see examples of this in the form of least squares regression and low rank approximation of matrices and tensors, as well as robust variants of these problems. In the context of distributed algorithms, dimensionality reduction leads to communication-efficient protocols, while in the context of data stream algorithms, it leads to memory-efficient algorithms. We will study some of the above problems in such models, such as low rank approximation, but also consider a variety of classical streaming problems such as counting distinct elements, finding frequent items, and estimating norms. Finally we will study lower bound methods in these models showing that many of the algorithms we covered are optimal or near-optimal. Such methods are often based on communication complexity and information-theoretic arguments.

The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.

This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

Mastering both principles and relevant models is important for those who wish to seriously understand how todays electric power grids work and their challenging technical issues.

This class seeks to teach students how to address the entire machine learning pipeline, starting from messy data and provisional questions and ending with actionable interpretations and insights.  The course will cover discovery, planning, analysis, and interpretation. Discovery involves understanding the data at hand, determining what is and is not answerable, and question generation. Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results.

The three concepts - proof, set, computation - are fundamental, in particular, for mathematics and computer science.

At the end of the semester, we hold an exhibition on campus to show class projects to the Carnegie Mellon community. The goal of the course is to take students with varying talents, backgrounds, and perspectives and put them together to do what they couldnt do alone.   The course is primarily for ETC graduate students, but occasionally other students are admitted by special permission from the instructors. To enroll, students must have ONE of the following skills: 3D modeling, high quality 2D art skills,strong programming skills, or the ability to compose and record original music and/or sound effects. The key is that there are no idea people in the course; everyone must share in the mechanical creation of the worlds. Students in the course may be assigned to a role that is not their primary skill set due to the distribution of the enrollees. This is a hands-on course and it takes a lot of time, but most students find it very fulfilling and fun. Note that we dont try to teach artists to program, or engineers to paint; we form teams where everyone does what theyre already skilled at to attack a joint project. Class time includes a split between regular lectures, display/critique of group projects, guest lectures and workshops designed to aid in world creation.

In the philosophy of science, for example, it has been claimed that different scientific theories, or particular claims or terms within these theories, are incommensurable.  In ethics, some have argued that different types of values (rights, utility, personal commitments, individual identities) are incommensurable.  In many cases, incommensurability is treated as a problem that needs to be surmounted in order for agents to make rational decisions to compare alternative theories or to evaluate acts or policies that implicate different kinds of value.  The first part of this course examines what incommensurability is supposed to be, how it supposedly arises in various fields, and what kind of challenge it poses for theories of rationality and rational choice.  In the second part of the course we examine theories in which incommensurability is not a problem to be overcome, but a kind of moral requirement in itself.  For instance, the injunction at the heart of Kantian ethics not to treat agents (with dignity) like things (with a price) requires that these entities not be brought into certain kinds of comparative relationship.  Similar claims seem to be at work in certain liberal political theories (Walzer and Rawls), in views that seek to limit the scope of goods that can be distributed in markets, and in views of science that treat conceptual diversity as an source of important social benefit.

In the late 20th century, an interdisciplinary group that included geographers, urban studies scholars, architects, sociologists, anthropologists and literary theorists began to theorize the social construction of space.  They argued that space is something dynamically created that may be interpreted for the ways it creates meaning.

This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions.  It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature.  Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis.

As a result, present-day decision makers face an increasingly formidable task of internalizing huge amounts of time-critical information while being expected to always make the right decisions at the right times.  Conveniently, Data Science comes to their rescue.  Applied Data Science aims to achieve two main goals. The first is to optimize the efficiency of decision making by human managers. The second is to maximize the utilization of available data, so that no important clue is ever missed. This course aims at building expertize required to achieve those goals in practice. Students will have the opportunity to gain and solidify knowledge of the most important contemporary methods of Data Science, and to develop understanding of practical applicability of the studied topics in business scenarios.

Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis.

The same word or phrase in English might actually carry very distinct connotations for someone whose native language is French, German, Russian, or Japanese. Can we learn to anticipate, understand, and become sensitive to these connotations? How can we mend potential miscommunications that might arise due to these conceptual differences?   This course is designed as an introduction to international professional communication. We will talk about the way in which culture influences communication, about the job of translators and interpreters, and about specific communicative norms for the global marketplace. We will look at many concrete example of communication in the international arena, acting as problem- solvers and communication consultants who are focused on understanding and designing plans of action for navigating communicative obstacles. We will also have the opportunity to speak with professionals who are experienced in the field, and we will cover case studies ranging from corporate business to global activism and advocacy.', 'postreqs': ['76-779'], 'units': 4.5, 'department': 'English', 'coreqs': None, 'prereqs': None}, '21-295': {'name': 'Putnam Seminar', 'desc': 'A problem solving seminar designed to prepare students to participate in the annual William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition.

In the philosophy of science, for example, it has been claimed that different scientific theories, or particular claims or terms within these theories, are incommensurable.  In ethics, some have argued that different types of values (rights, utility, personal commitments, individual identities) are incommensurable.  In many cases, incommensurability is treated as a problem that needs to be surmounted in order for agents to make rational decisions to compare alternative theories or to evaluate acts or policies that implicate different kinds of value.  The first part of this course examines what incommensurability is supposed to be, how it supposedly arises in various fields, and what kind of challenge it poses for theories of rationality and rational choice.  In the second part of the course we examine theories in which incommensurability is not a problem to be overcome, but a kind of moral requirement in itself.  For instance, the injunction at the heart of Kantian ethics not to treat agents (with dignity) like things (with a price) requires that these entities not be brought into certain kinds of comparative relationship.  Similar claims seem to be at work in certain liberal political theories (Walzer and Rawls), in views that seek to limit the scope of goods that can be distributed in markets, and in views of science that treat conceptual diversity as an source of important social benefit.  A goal of the course is to show how a variety of issues across diverse philosophical contexts have a common structure and how formal work in social choice (e.g., Arrovian impossibility results), and decision theory (e.g., theories of choice that relax the ordering assumption) can help to clarify and resolve important problems.', 'postreqs': [], 'units': 12.0, 'department': 'Philosophy', 'coreqs': None, 'prereqs': None}, '99-530': {'name': 'Senior Preparation Seminar', 'desc': 'This mini course provides graduating seniors a chance to reflect on their experiences as students at Carnegie Mellon; intellectually, socially and as leaders in this community.

This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising your own writing and the writing of others.  Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved good style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?', 'postreqs': [], 'units': None, 'department': 'English', 'coreqs': None, 'prereqs': None}, '36-315': {'name': 'Statistical Graphics and Visualization', 'desc': 'Graphical displays of quantitative information take on many forms as they help us understand both data and models.

Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders.

Racism is a complex phenomenon that refers to historically hierarchical power differences between groups (e.g. Native populations and Europeans during the conquest), ideas about how humans can be classified into groups by race, and also discriminatory practices against non-dominant groups. This system of social relations and ideology serves to justify social inequality and differential treatment.  If we are to end racism, we must strive to understand it.

Why has the struggle against racism shifted from a demand for human rights to a search for diversity and inclusion? This course will examine racism in Pittsburgh, in the United States, and in several other countries and regions throughout the world. We will approach racism from multiple academic perspectives with a team of three faculty from the departments of History, English and Modern Languages.

The beginning of the semester focuses on building materials and on tool use.  Through the center of the semester course material focuses on traditional scenery practices.  The end of the semester material addresses rigging systems and scenery rigging practices.  Laboratory assignments tied to this course will consist of carpentry assignments in the shop and carpentry and rigging assignments during load in.  Occasionally students pursuing a more customized path may have lab assignments in the paint department in the shop and in the electrics department during install.

This Digital Humanities/ Hispanic Studies course is aimed at examining representations of (super)heroes in Spanish, Latin American, and Latinx comics and graphic novels. What constitutes a (super)hero? Which cultural values does this type of character promote? What kinds of political societies do they appear in, and how do issues of gender, race, and ethnicity play out in these comics? In order to answer these questions, the course delves into a selection of popular comic books and graphic novels from the Spanish-speaking world, and provides the skills for reading these works critically as cultural artifacts in terms of what they depict and how they do so. We will also use these comics to develop a historical and theoretical exploration of Spanish, Latin American, and Latinx popular culture, narrative, history, and society. Analytic methods include hands-on instruction in Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, as one of the tools to encode and analyze the structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of these comics as documents combining pictorial and textual elements.  Expectations include diligent reading, active participation, written responses, creative and analytical writing, and a final project that involves encoding of texts in CBML.

In the early modern period, England had a complex multifaceted relation to the Islamic world. Since the Crusades, England had thought of the Islamic world as a deadly religious enemy to annihilate, but at the end of the sixteenth century, the Islamic world was also a key diplomatic ally against the Spanish archenemy, a fabulously rich trading partner in the world emporium of the Mediterranean sea, and an efficient model of empire to emulate in the Atlantic world. As a result, the Islamic world came to occupy a central place in English national imagination and maintained that place throughout the seventeenth century. What fantasies about the Islamic world does early modern English literature reveal? How do religion, race, gender, and sexuality intersect in the formation of those cultural fantasies? Do authors reinforce those fantasies or pressure them? How do specifically English social, political, and cultural issues inform literary representations of Islam? What image of England emerges when English authors use Islam as a mirror for the nation? In other words, what do texts about Islam tell us about early modern England? To answer those questions, we will read across genres, comparing romances, epic poems, plays, travel writing, pamphlets, and essays, and we will set canonical authors such as Chaucer, Spenser, Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Milton in conversation with other illuminating early modern writers such as Richard Knolles, George Sandys, Robert Daborne, Henry Stubbe, and Mary Pix.', 'postreqs': [], 'units': 9.0, 'department': 'English', 'coreqs': None, 'prereqs': '[76-101]'}, '79-419': {'name': 'Topics in Russian Language & Culture: 20th Century Russian Masterpieces', 'desc': 'The October Revolution of 1917 had profound effects not only for Russian society, but also for literature and culture.

Often, behind a foreign accent, we encounter an entirely different worldview. The same word or phrase in English might actually carry very distinct connotations for someone whose native language is French, German, Russian, or Japanese. Can we learn to anticipate, understand, and become sensitive to these connotations? How can we mend potential miscommunications that might arise due to these conceptual differences?   This course is designed as an introduction to international professional communication. We will talk about the way in which culture influences communication, about the job of translators and interpreters, and about specific communicative norms for the global marketplace.

Description: This course focuses on algorithms for three-dimensional geometry processing, while simultaneously providing a first course in traditional differential geometry. Students will learn how fundamental geometric concepts (like curvature) can be understood from complementary computational and mathematical points of view. This dual perspective enriches understanding on both sides, and leads to the development of practical algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. Along the way we will revisit important ideas from calculus and (numerical) linear algebra, putting a strong emphasis on intuitive, visual understanding that complements the more traditional formal, algebraic treatment. The course provides essential mathematical background as well as a large array of real-world examples and applications. It also provides a short survey of recent developments in digital geometry processing and discrete differential geometry. Topics include: curves and surfaces, curvature, connections and parallel transport, exterior algebra, exterior calculus, Stokes theorem, simplicial homology, de Rham cohomology, Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, conformal mapping, finite element methods, and numerical linear algebra. Applications include: approximation of curvature, curve and surface smoothing, surface parameterization, vector field design, and computation of geodesic distance....', 'postreqs': [], 'units': 12.0, 'department': 'SCS: Computer Science', 'coreqs': None, 'prereqs': None}, '82-320': {'name': 'Contemporary Society in Germany, Austria and Switzerland', 'desc': 'This course offers an introduction to contemporary German culture since 1989.

In early sixteenth century Europe, race was a complex system of power distribution that relied primarily on religious or rank-based difference. With the development of colonization and color-based slavery in the Atlantic world, the early modern racial matrix produced a new paradigm: Europeans started thinking about physiological difference - for which skin color was a shorthand - in racial terms too. How were those various racial paradigms (religion, rank, skin color) represented in one of the most important mass media of the time - theatre? How did those paradigms interact in one given play or one given national culture? Did they reinforce or work against one another? Which features were specific to nationally defined racial epistemes? Which features circulated across national borders? How did the translation and mistranslation of racial notions from one culture into another shape a sense of shared whiteness in early modern Europe? Which performance techniques did actors use to impersonate racial others, and what effect did those techniques have on spectators? In short, how did early modern theatre participate in the making of race? To answer those questions, we will focus on a rich corpus of plays staging Jews, Moors and Blackamoors, New World Indians, Gypsies, and Turks.

In early sixteenth century Europe, race was a complex system of power distribution that relied primarily on religious or rank-based difference. With the development of colonization and color-based slavery in the Atlantic world, the early modern racial matrix produced a new paradigm: Europeans started thinking about physiological difference - for which skin color was a shorthand - in racial terms too. How were those various racial paradigms (religion, rank, skin color) represented in one of the most important mass media of the time - theatre? How did those paradigms interact in one given play or one given national culture? Did they reinforce or work against one another? Which features were specific to nationally defined racial epistemes? Which features circulated across national borders? How did the translation and mistranslation of racial notions from one culture into another shape a sense of shared whiteness in early modern Europe? Which performance techniques did actors use to impersonate racial others, and what effect did those techniques have on spectators? In short, how did early modern theatre participate in the making of race? To answer those questions, we will focus on a rich corpus of plays staging Jews, Moors and Blackamoors, New World Indians, Gypsies, and Turks. We will read plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Molire (among others) in conversation with secondary readings drawn from the field of Critical Race Studies.
